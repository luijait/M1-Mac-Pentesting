# M1-Mac-Pentesting

This page is meant to help people know what resources are compatible with the new M1 chip on the 2021+ Macbook Pros. I love the speed and the battery life of the new M1 Mac, but because it ARM64 there will be some issues with compatibility for exisitng programs. Apple has introduced Rosetta 2 which helps temporarily with any 32/64 bit programs run on MacOS. This is meant to be a temporary solution until developers can port their apps over to the new ARM64 architecture.

I will be listing out several programs and workarounds I have used to setup my M1 Mac as a pentesting machine.


## Virtualization

Keep in mind that the virtualization software AND the image being used must be ARM64 compatible. My personal favorite out of all of these is Parallels. It is paid, but the developers do an incredible job at maintaining the code, and the speed is incredible. No other virtualization software for Mac is even close. VMWare Fusion has fallen behind in my opinion, but try them all out and see what works best. Parallels also has ARM64 images for download right after installation (Kali, Windows 11, Debian, etc.)
