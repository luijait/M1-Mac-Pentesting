# M1 Mac Pentesting

This page is meant to help people know what resources are compatible with the new M1 chip on the 2021+ Macbook Pros. I love the speed and the battery life of the new M1 Mac, but because it ARM64 there will be some issues with compatibility for exisitng programs. Apple has introduced Rosetta 2 which helps temporarily with any 32/64 bit programs run on MacOS. This is meant to be a temporary solution until developers can port their apps over to the new ARM64 architecture.

I will be listing out several programs and workarounds I have used to setup my M1 Mac as a pentesting machine.


# Virtualization

Keep in mind that the virtualization software AND the image being used must be ARM64 compatible. My personal favorite out of all of these is Parallels. It is paid, but the developers do an incredible job at maintaining the code, and the speed is incredible. No other virtualization software for Mac is even close. VMWare Fusion has fallen behind in my opinion, but try them all out and see what works best. Parallels also has ARM64 images for download right after installation (Kali, Windows 11, Debian, etc.)

✅ **VMWare Fusion (Free preview version) - COMPATIBLE WITH ARM64**

[Download Link](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/downloads/get-download?downloadGroup=FUS-PUBTP-2021H1)

❌ **Oracle VirtualBox - NOT COMPATIBLE**

✅ **Parallels (Paid) - COMPATIBLE WITH ARM64**

✅ **Docker (Free) - COMPATIBLE WITH ARM64**

✅ **UTM - COMPATIBLE WITH ARM64**

### ISO Images for Virtual Machines

✅ **Windows 11** 

[Download Link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewARM64)

Developer preview (free account required to download, or can download directly in Parallels interface)

✅ **Kali Linux**

[Download Link](https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-2021.4/kali-linux-2021.4-installer-arm64.iso)

✅ **Debian**

[Download Link](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/arm64/iso-cd/)

✅ **Ubuntu**

[Download Link](https://ubuntu.com/download/server/arm)

❌ **Parrot OS**

Currently being worked on as of Dec 19, 2021

✅ **Arch Linux**

[Download Link](https://archlinuxarm.org/)

❌ **Windows Commando by FireEye**

Currently not compatible with Windows 11 ARM64 Developer preview. I tested the install script and it breaks the VM. Good think I took a snapshot before I started the install process. I'm seeing how hard it would be to port it over to Windows 11 ARM64. Most apps can be emulated for 64bit and 32bit so I'll dig through the install script.

# Notes About Kali Linux ARM64 on M1 Mac Parallels

I will update my notes here about my experience of running Kali Linux

# Software

Below is a list of software that I use regularly that I've tested out on my M1 mac. I will list if it's ARM64(✅) compatible, or if Rosetta 2(❌) is required to run it:

⚠️ **Burp Suite**

Works amazing on M1 machine, but Rosetta 2 is required. Install as normal and enter your license key if using the pro version.

✅ **VSCode**

Natively supports ARM64

(https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

✅ **Visual Studio**

This is a developer preview version but the community version should be released early 2022.

(https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2022-for-mac-preview-3-and-upcoming-native-m1-processor-support/)

✅ **Notion.so**

Natively supports ARM64 - My favorite app for taking notes. Only downside is internet is required.

✅ **Bitwarden**

Natively supports ARM64 - My favorite password manager app (and it's free)
