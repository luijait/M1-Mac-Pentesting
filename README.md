# M1-Mac-Pentesting

This page is meant to help people know what resources are compatible with the new M1 chip on the 2021+ Macbook Pros. I love the speed and the battery life of the new M1 Mac, but because it ARM64 there will be some issues with compatibility for exisitng programs. Apple has introduced Rosetta 2 which helps temporarily with any 32/64 bit programs run on MacOS. This is meant to be a temporary solution until developers can port their apps over to the new ARM64 architecture.

I will be listing out several programs and workarounds I have used to setup my M1 Mac as a pentesting machine.


## Virtualization

Keep in mind that the virtualization software AND the image being used must be ARM64 compatible.
